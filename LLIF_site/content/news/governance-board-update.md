LLIF has completed formation of its independent oversight board and published the first version of the Participant Data Charter.

## The Board

The LLIF board is structured to provide independent oversight of the organization's mission alignment. Members serve fixed terms and are not employed by LLIF. Compensation is disclosed annually in the Form 990.

The board holds authority over:

- Changes to the participant data charter
- Material changes to the data partner agreement
- Executive compensation and organizational audits
- Any proposed changes to LLIF's nonprofit status

This is a deliberate structural choice. Participant trust requires that no single executive — including the founder — can unilaterally change how data is handled.

## The Participant Data Charter

The Participant Data Charter is a plain-language commitment to participants that governs how LLIF handles their data. Key commitments:

1. **You own your data.** LLIF holds it in trust on your behalf.
2. **You can export it.** Full data exports are available at any time, in standard formats.
3. **You can delete it.** Deletion requests are processed within 30 days, subject to legal retention requirements.
4. **It will not be sold.** Participant data is a donor-restricted asset. This cannot be changed by any future leadership.
5. **You will be notified of access.** Every research or partner access is logged and visible in your participant dashboard.

## Annual Transparency Report

The first LLIF Annual Transparency Report will be published alongside the Form 990 filing later this year. It will include financial statements, board meeting summaries, and a data access log summary.

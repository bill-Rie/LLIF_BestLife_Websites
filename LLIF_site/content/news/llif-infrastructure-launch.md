LLIF has officially launched as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, establishing a new model for ethical data infrastructure built in Raleigh, NC.

## What We're Building

At its core, LLIF is infrastructure — not a consumer app, not a health platform, and not a data broker. We are a nonprofit foundation that provides the technical and legal substrate for programs, researchers, and developers to build upon.

Participant data is classified as a **donor-restricted asset** under IRS rules. This means it cannot be sold, monetized, or transferred in an acquisition — regardless of any future change in leadership or organizational circumstance.

## Why Structure Matters

A for-profit company cannot make the same promise. Business conditions change. Investors demand returns. Companies get acquired. The nonprofit structure is not a marketing choice — it is a structural guarantee that aligns long-term incentives with participant welfare.

## What Comes Next

Over the next 12 months, LLIF will:

- Open the developer API to program organizers and research institutions
- Publish the participant data charter
- File and make publicly available our first annual Form 990
- Launch grant partnership agreements with research institutions

We are grateful to the early partners and advisors who helped bring this infrastructure to life. There is much work ahead.

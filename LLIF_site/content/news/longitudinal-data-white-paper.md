LLIF has published a white paper examining how nonprofit data infrastructure can address longstanding challenges in longitudinal community health research.

## The Problem

Community health researchers face a persistent set of structural problems:

- **Participant attrition** — people disengage from multi-year studies when they see no benefit from participation
- **Data silos** — health and lifestyle data is scattered across institutions with no interoperability
- **Consent fatigue** — participants are re-consented repeatedly across studies using different forms
- **Data loss at grant transitions** — when funding ends, data custody becomes legally ambiguous

These are not technical problems. They are structural ones — and they require structural solutions.

## The LLIF Approach

LLIF provides a persistent data home for participants that exists independently of any single study or grant cycle. When a researcher partners with LLIF:

- Participants consent once to a framework, not to each individual study
- Data persists beyond the grant period under nonprofit protection
- Researchers access data via API with audit trails satisfying IRB requirements
- Participants can view, export, and revoke access at any time

## Key Findings

The white paper synthesizes evidence from 40+ longitudinal studies to argue that participant-owned, nonprofit-stewarded data infrastructure produces:

- 34% lower attrition in multi-year studies (weighted average across reviewed literature)
- Higher data completeness when participants understand and control what is collected
- Reduced IRB friction for secondary analyses when consent frameworks are pre-established
